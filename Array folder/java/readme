Array in java 
The general form of a one-dimensional array declaration is 
type var-name[];
OR
type[] var-name;

An array declaration has two components: the type and the name.
  type declares the element type of the array. 
  The element type determines the data type of each element that comprises the array. Like an array of integers, 
  we can also create an array of other primitive data types like char, float, double, etc., or user-defined data types (objects of a class). 
  Thus, the element type for the array determines what type of data the array will hold. 
 The general form of new as it applies to one-dimensional arrays appears as follows: 

var-name = new type [size];
  Here, type specifies the type of data being allocated, size determines the number of elements in the array, 
  and var-name is the name of the array variable that is linked to the array.
  To use new to allocate an array, you must specify the type and number of elements to allocate.
    Example: 
    int intArray[];    //declaring array
    intArray = new int[20];  // allocating memory to array
    
Obtaining an array is a two-step process.
  First, you must declare a variable of the desired array type.
  Second, you must allocate the memory to hold the array, using new, and assign it to the array variable. 
  Thus, in Java, all arrays are dynamically allocated.
